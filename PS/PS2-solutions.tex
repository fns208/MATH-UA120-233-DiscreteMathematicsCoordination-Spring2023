\begin{question}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Disprove: Every triangle has at least one obtuse angle.
        \item Disprove: For all real numbers $x$, $x^2\geq x$.
        \item Disprove: For every positive nonprime integer $n$, if some prime $p$ divides $n$, 
            then some other prime $q$ ($q\neq p$) also divides $n$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
% Student: put your answer between the next two lines.
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Note that the sum of all the angles in a triangle must sum to 180 degrees. Then we can have a triangle with angle 60 degrees each and all of them are less than 90 degrees, which is not obtuse. Therefore the statement is false.

\item Consider $x=\frac{1}{2}$, which is a real number. Note that $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{4}< \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore the statement $x^2\geq x$ is false.

\item Consider $n=9$, which is a positive nonprime integer. Notice that the prime number $p=3$ divides 9. But since $9=3^2$, no other prime number divides 9. Therefore the statement is false.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{question}
   (Scheinerman, Exercise 7.12:)
    Another method to prove that certain Boolean formulas
    are tautologies is to use the properties in Theorem~7.2
    together with the fact that $x \rightarrow y$ is equivalent
    to $(\neg x) \vee y$ (Proposition~7.3)
    For example, Exercise 7.11, part (b) asks you to establish that the formula $(x \wedge (x \rightarrow y)) \rightarrow y$ is 
    a tautology.  Here is a derivation of that fact:
    % This is an "align" environment for aligning
    % mathematical equations.  Ampersands (&) denote 
    % separation between columns.  The first one means
    % there will be alignment around the equal sign.
    % The double-ampersands put a second column, left-
    % justified.  Double-backslashes (\\) separate lines.
    \begin{align*}
        (x \wedge (x \rightarrow y)) \rightarrow y
        &= [x \wedge (\neg x \vee y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{translate $\rightarrow$} 
        \\
        &= [(x \wedge \neg x) \vee (x \wedge y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{distributive}
        \\
        &= [\mathrm{FALSE} \vee (x\wedge y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{inverse elements}
        \\
        &= (x\wedge y) \rightarrow y
        && \text{identity element}
        \\
        &= \neg(x\wedge y) \vee y
        && \text{translate $\rightarrow$}
        \\
        &= (\neg x \vee \neg y) \vee y
        && \text{De~Morgan's laws}
        \\
        &= \neg x \vee (\neg y \vee y)
        && \text{associativity}
        \\
        &= \neg x \vee \mathrm{TRUE}
        && \text{inverse elements}
        \\
        &= \mathrm{TRUE}
        && \text{identity element}
        \\
    \end{align*}
    Use this technique [not truth tables] to prove that these formulas
    are tautologies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(x \rightarrow \mathrm{FALSE}) \rightarrow \neg x$
        \item $(x \rightarrow y) \wedge (x \rightarrow \neg y) \rightarrow \neg x$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
% Student: put your answer between the next two lines.
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item
        \begin{align*}
            (x \rightarrow \mathrm{FALSE}) \rightarrow \neg x
            &=\neg(\neg x \vee \mathrm{FALSE}) \vee \neg x
          \\&=(x \wedge \mathrm{TRUE}) \vee \neg x 
          \\&=(x \vee \neg x)\wedge(\mathrm{TRUE} \vee \neg x) 
          \\&= \mathrm{TRUE} \wedge \mathrm{TRUE} = \mathrm{TRUE}
        \end{align*}
        \item
        \begin{align*}
            (x \rightarrow y) \wedge (x \rightarrow \neg y) \rightarrow \neg x
            &= \neg((\neg x \vee y) \wedge (\neg x \vee \neg y)) \vee \neg x
          \\&= (\neg(\neg x \vee y) \vee \neg(\neg x \vee \neg y)) \vee \neg x
          \\&= ((x \wedge \neg y) \vee (x \wedge y)) \vee \neg x
          \\&= (x \wedge (\neg y \vee y))\vee \neg x
          \\&= (x \wedge \mathrm{TRUE}) \vee \neg x
          \\&= x \vee \neg x = \mathrm{TRUE}
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}




\begin{question}
   (Scheinerman, Exercise 7.16:)
Here is another Boolean operation called \textit{exclusive or}; it is denoted by the symbol $\xor$. It is defined in the following table.
	% This is an "array" environment for aligning
	% individual objects. It is similar to "align"
	% Right after we \begin{array}, we indicate
	% how we want to align each individual column:
	% "c" for centered, "r" for right-justified,
	% "l" ("ell") for left-justified.
	% The total number of c's, r's, and l's should match
	% the number of columns.
	% We can use this to form a table. To create the borders,
	% we use "|" (the notation for "divides") to create a
	% vertical line between each column.
	% After each line, double-backslashes (\\) separate lines.
	% If we want a horizontal line after each line, 
	% we use "\hline".
	%For math environment, we can use "$$" or "\[ \]".
	\[\begin{array}{| c | c || c |}
	\hline
	x & y & x \xor y \\
	\hline
	T & T & F \\ 
	T & F & T \\
	F & T & T \\
	F & F & F \\
	\hline
	\end{array}\]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove that $x \xor y$ is logically equivalent to $(x \wedge \neg y) \vee ((\neg x) \wedge y)$.
        \item Prove that $x \xor y$ is logically equivalent to $(x \vee y) \wedge (\neg (x \wedge y))$.
        \item Explain why the operation $\xor$ is called \textit{exclusive or}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
% Student: put your answer between the next two lines.
\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\[\begin{array}{| c | c || c | c | c |}
	\hline
	x & y & x\wedge \neg y & (\neg x)\wedge y & (x \wedge \neg y) \vee ((\neg x) \wedge y)\\
	\hline
		T & T & F & F & F\\
		T & F & T & F & T\\
		F & T & F & T & T\\
		F & F & F & F & F\\
	\hline
	\end{array}\]
	\item 
	\[\begin{array}{| c | c || c | c | c |}
	\hline
	x & y & x\vee y & \neg (x \wedge y) & (x \vee y) \wedge (\neg (x \wedge y))\\
	\hline
		T & T & T & F & F\\
		T & F & T & T & T\\
		F & T & T & T & T\\
		F & F & F & T & F\\
	\hline
	\end{array}\]
	\item It is called ``\textit{exclusive or}'' because it captures the exclusive nature of the English ``\textit{or}'': you have have option A or B, \textit{but not both}. In the same way $x\xor y$ when $x$ or $y$ \textit{but not both} are $\mathtt{TRUE}$.

\begin{question}
    Suppose each single character stored in a computer uses eight bits. 
    Then each character is represented by a different sequence of eight 0's and 1's called a bit pattern, 
    such as 10011101 or 00100010. Provide a brief reasoning for the following questions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How many different bit patterns are there?
            \item How many different bit patterns are palindromes (the same backwards as forwards)?
            \item How many different bit patterns have an even number of 1's?
            \item How many different bit patterns have the property that their second and fourth digits are 1's?
            \item How many different bit patterns have the property that their second or fourth digits are 1's?
        \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
% Student: put your answer between the next two lines.
\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Since there are eight digits and two choices of $\{0, 1\}$, there are $2^8$ different bit patterns. 
        \item Since the pattern repeats halfway, there's only a choice for the first four digits; there are $2^4$ different palindromes.
        \item To ensure there are an even number of 1's, the first seven digits can be anything and we only need to adjust the eighth digit; meaning there is only one choice for the eighth digit. There are $2^7$ different bit patterns with an even number of 1's.
        \item Since there are no restrictions on everything else that is not second and fourth digit, there are $2^6$ different bit patterns where the second and fourth digit are 1's.
        \item We need to count the different bit patterns where only the second digit is a 1, only the fourth digit is a 1, and the second and the fourth digit is a 1. There are $2^6+2^6+2^6$ different bit patterns where the second or fourth digit are 1's.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{question}
    Suppose we want to make a list of length 5 from the letters $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J$. Provide a brief reasoning for the following questions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed and the list must begin with a vowel?
            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed and the list must end with a vowel?
            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed and the list must contain exactly one $A$?
        \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
% Student: put your answer between the next two lines.
\begin{solution}
Note that there are 10 letters to choose from and out of those letters, $A, E, I$ are vowels.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Since there are five positions where the first element has 3 choices of vowels and no repetition is allowed, there are $3\cdot 9 \cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6$ lists with no repetition and begins with a vowel. 
        \item Since the only restriction is the last element in the list, we will choose a vowel for the last element in the list first and then the remaining elements in the list. There are $3\cdot 9 \cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6$ lists with no repetition and ends with a vowel. 
        \item Consider the first element of the list must be an $A$, then the remaining elements of the list can be any of the 9 remaining letters, which are $9 \cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6$ different possibilities. Since the letter $A$ can be in any of the five positions in the list, there are $5\cdot 9 \cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6$ lists with no repetition and exactly one $A$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
